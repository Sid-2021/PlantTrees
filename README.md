<H1>Tree Plantation : The need of the Hour</H1>
This project is to build a website where people can learn about the importance of trees , they can donate for tree plantation and can also get notified about nearby plantation drives.

Tree Plantation is one of the best activities for making the planet greener, livelier, and healthier. Planted trees help our biodiversity, ensure the supply of oxygen for the next generations, and provide us with various resources. Without trees, the existence of human life, as well as other species on earth, is impossible. So, we should plant more and more trees.

Tree-planting is the process of transplanting tree seedlings, generally for forestry, land reclamation, or landscaping purpose. 
Tree Plantation drives combat many environmental issues like deforestation, erosion of soil, desertification in semi-arid areas, global warming and hence enhancing the beauty and balance of the environment. Trees absorb harmful gases and emit oxygen resulting in an increase in oxygen supply. 

So, here we are making an website which will inform people about the neccescity of planting trees and also notify them about community based organized drives for participation and also help them to donate in this cause .
